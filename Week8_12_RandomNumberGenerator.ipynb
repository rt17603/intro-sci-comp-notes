This is why it is called a *pseudo* random number generator: because the output is not truly random. True random number generators can be created by using some input from an unpredictable external source (mouse movement, CPU temperature fluctuations or events such as radioactive decay, cosmic rays etc.) but this loses one of the great benefits of pseudo random number generators: repeatability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple example and, in most circumstances, the level of randomness afforded by a *good* pseudorandom number generator, with many iterations between repeating patterns, is sufficient for any model we may want to create. Through use of a known seed number we can re-run models which include randomness and, unlike real-life experiments, still be able to reproduce the same results. However, if you ever did need true randomness then this should be factored into the choice of tool being used."
